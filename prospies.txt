I love to receive email from prospective PhD students with a strong background
in computer science, linguistics and maths. However, I receive an inordinate
number of requests from students who clearly have little idea of what research
I am involved in, so to avoid genuine enquiries getting lost in the spam,
I have instigated the following protocol for prospective students:

- I am not able to take on interns. Rather than respond to each such request
  personally in the negative, allow me to make a blanket statement here that I
  unfortunately can't help you out, and wish you the best with your
  search. There, I've put it out there, so don't expect any email response
  from me for any such enquiries.

- As a general rule, I won't take on any PhD students wanting to do generic
  data mining/machine learning projects, unless you can make a specific case
  for how your proposed project relates directly to my work in computational
  linguistics. Any requests for PhD supervision in areas not relating to my
  research interests demonstrate that you haven't done your homework in
  checking my web page and spotting this statement, in which case, don't
  expect to get any response from me.

- Assuming you don't fall into either of the above categories, I'd love to
  hear from you. In your initial email, make sure to include a CV and a brief
  statement of your research interests (or actual proposal if you have one).
